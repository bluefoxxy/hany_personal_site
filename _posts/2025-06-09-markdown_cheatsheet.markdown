What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language for web writers. Markdown allows you to add formatting elements to plaintext documents and then convert them to structurally valid HTML.

Markdown syntax can be divided into two broad categories. These categories are (1) basic syntax outlined in the original design document and (2) extension of basic syntax for added capability and features.

Refer to Markdown cheat sheet for more examples.
Basic syntax

These elements are defined in the original Markdown design document and can be used in all Markdown applications.

Detailed information and examples can be fount at basic syntax guide.

Extended syntax

These elements provide additional features by extending the basic syntax. Not all Markdown applications support these elements and each Markdown Flavor differs slightly.

Note that GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax called GitHub Flavored Markdown and some features are only available in the issues and pull requests.

Refer to Jekyll Markdown coverage for a list of supported elements.

Detailed information and examples can be fount at extended syntax guide.
