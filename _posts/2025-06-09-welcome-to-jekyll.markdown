It's been a while since working in Jekyll. But setting up the env, goin through dependencies, sorting out why certain gems werent working, and figuring out a lightweight env to easily deploy felt somewhat invigorating. I even shamefully but funnily struggled for 30 mins to get my Jekyll setup on Git Pages. 

Working in Jekyll is nice. Simple. Easy. Setting up post feels intuitive, and simply pushing changes should make life easy when using this.

Styling has been a little bit of a nuisance. There's no simple way to do a bundle or gem for a boostrap for Jekyll. That will take some time. But, in the course of 3 hours, I was able to get the env up and running smoothly. It appears though that the default theme has capabilities for responsiveness so im prolly just gonna use that to save time.

Next steps are to find a bootstrap that will actually work well with Jekyll. Two unknowns is that minima is throwing a bunch of warnings that I gotta fix. The other is that I'm using the default theme, and I'm not sure if I want to just use that and overwrite or create one from scratch. I'm leaning toward using the existing theme and changing it to my liking but it does come with its own set of headaches... But creating my own means way more time. 

I gotta find a markdown cheat sheet for jekyll... That's it for now though.
